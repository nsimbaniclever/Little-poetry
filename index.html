                I'm getting tired <br>
                Of such technology <br>
                We only talk by email <br>
                Short and cold message <br>
                Twitter and Facebook <br>
                Before I expire <br>
                I will say everything in poetry.

                It is no longer as it was before <br>
                It's all abbreviated <br>
                "You" only has two letters <br>
                The" O "and" E " were crossed out <br>
                To declare love <br>
                Just put a flower <br>
                And a drawn heart.

                Arroba now does not weigh <br>
                It is part of an address <br>
                Full stop neither is used <br>
                Or go to the beginning <br>
                Now it is .with <br>
                If the saite is very good <br>
                He is worth a high price. 
            </p>
            <p>
                To make matters worse <br>
                Emoticon is a risk <br>
                It has symbol for everything <br>
                Semicolon and an asterisk <br>
                A kiss means <br>
                To understand how it is <br>
                Decipher that scribble.

                I miss the letters <br>
                Written with his own hand <br>
                Sent in the month of June <br>
                It only came in the summer <br>
                But it killed nostalgia <br>
                It was real text <br>
                On the lines of the heart.

                Now I write and send <br>
                Arriving at the same time <br>
                But when I go prosear <br>
                The person left <br>
                Opened another app <br>
                The world became captive <br>
                The technology of now.

                Fortunately, to pray <br>
                Do not need internet <br>
                God listens to everyone <br>
                If you want, take this test <br>
                Two points are two knees <br>
                Your lips are braces <br>
                Let God interpret.
